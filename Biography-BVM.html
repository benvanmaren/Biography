    <h2>A Big Empty Desert</h2>
    <p>Ben was born in Tucson, Arizona in southern Arizona. He was born with his twin sister
        Katie to parents Gretchen and Jeff. Both of his parents moved to Tucson to start
        a family. <em>(Everyone always asks--yes, Ben was the second to come out.) </em>Baby Ben
        was known to be very animated and do tai-kwon-do moves in his spare time. He also
        really loved his family dog, Mollie, until Mollie started biting Ben's hands</p>
        <p>Tucson was the foundation of Ben's childhood, teenage years, and early adult life.
            He went to his neighborhood schools through his life, from preschool to high school.
            The University of Arizona was Ben's college of choice because he was inpsired by
            biological sciences and health science. He graduated during May 2017 with a 
            major in Molecular and Cellular Biology and a minor in Public Health. Since then,
            he has been pursuing his Pbulic Health career and will come back to school for 
            more education.</p>
